# Personal AI Modeled After My Own Personal Data
Welcome to my personal AI project! This project aims to create a personal AI that anyone can talk to, modeled after my own personal data. The AI uses a combination of natural language processing tools and deep learning models to generate personalized responses based on the user's query.

## Technologies Used
The project utilizes the following technologies:

- GPT-4: a deep learning language model that generates human-like text
- Llama_index: a search engine for natural language queries
- Langchain: a tool for processing and analyzing personal data
- OpenAI: a tool for natural language processing and machine learning
- Streamlit: a web application framework for deploying the project

## Installation
To install and run the project locally, follow these steps:

- Clone the repository to your local machine
- Run the application using streamlit run app.py

## Usage
Once the application is running, you can interact with the personal AI by typing your query into the text input field and press enter to apply. The AI will then generate a personalized response based on your query and my personal data.
